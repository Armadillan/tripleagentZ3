* Incorporate extra roles (triple agend, suspicious service etc)
* Incorporate Hidden Agenda
* Create "live" tool, usable during gameplay
    * Prompt for new info
    * Give updated variants after each new piece of information
         * Alert when at least one virus is identified
         * Calculate percent chance that each player is virus?
    * Suggest which players to pick for secret intel, confession etc
         * Calculate bits of information aquired from each option
